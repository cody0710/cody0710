- Hi there, I’m cody0710. This is my pseudo-account that I have been using since Microsoft M&A'ed it 25 years ago.
- You can contact me at cody0710@hotmail.com but please don't send me promotions, commerce, or something else ;)
- Speaking of the posture of current affairs, I'm working on organizing useful URL link lists that might help anyone who wants to get Microsoft Azure Certifications and AWS Certs.
- Please sit back and relax when you browsing my URL links. I wouldn't say they are a compilation of cheatsheets but rather they are regaraded as crib notes.
- But, rember this, if you mastered all the contents I'll show you as described hereinafter, I'm sure you'll pass them with no hustle or tension.

- I’m interested in working in Singapore or Canada.
- Currently I’m heavily learning C# and French :)
- I’m looking to collaborate on the knowledge that will levelage you to the ready state to take Cisco, Microsoft, and Amazon exams
- I used pass the CEH, CompTIA Network+, Security+, and some other Linux related exams (LPIC1/2/3, 304, VMware VCP, Citrix CCP) 
and all of them are expired too. So I'm not sure if I can give you worrthy advice because they are completely changed compared to the back in the days.
