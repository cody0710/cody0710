- Hi, cody0710 is one of my pseudonym and restarted using GitHub recently to share my learning experiences with other developers.
- You can contact me at cody0710'at'hotmail.com for discussions but please don't send me anything nonsense such as cold emails. ;)
- Speaking of current activities, I'm working on organizing URL lists that might help you pass Microsoft Azure Certs and AWS Certs.
- I wouldn't say they are a compilation of cheat sheets rather they're regaraded as crib notes that have been pulled out of my head.
- Might I remind you first, if you mastered all the contents here, I'm sure you'll pass them with no hustle-up no stressed-out.
- I’m interested in working in Singapore or Canada (Living in Tokyo at the moment and love it. :)
- Currently I’m heavily learning C#, Kubernetes, and French. :)
- I’ve been trying to elaborate on the knowledge that'll prepare you to be in a good shape for Microsoft and Amazon's cloud exams.
- I had CEH, CompTIA Network+, Security+, and some other Linux related certs way long time ago. All of them are expired though. 
- So I'm not sure if I can advise you something worthy because they are completely different compared to the ones in the past.
- However, last but not least, I'm an active / valid CCNP holder who also has a few cloud certifications that Microsoft has to offer.
