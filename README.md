- Hi there, I’m cody0710. Here I'm using one of my pseudo-accounts that I have been using since Microsoft M&A'ed the hotmail 25 years ago.
- You can contact me at cody0710@hotmail.com but please don't send me any sales promo, commercial marketing campaigns, or something else ;)
- Speaking of current activities, I'm working on organizing URL link lists that might help you pass Microsoft Azure Certs and AWS Certs.
- I wouldn't say they are a compilation of cheat sheets but rather they are regaraded as crib notes that have been pulled out of my head.
- Might I remind you first, if you mastered all the contents here, I'm sure you'll pass them with no hustle nor stressed-out mind.

- I’m interested in working in Singapore or Canada (Living in Tokyo at the moment and love it :).
- Currently I’m heavily learning C# and French. :)
- I’m looking to collaborate on the knowledge that will levelage you to be in a good shape to take Cisco, Microsoft, and Amazon exams
- I had CEH, CompTIA Network+, Security+, and some other Linux related certs way long time ago and all of them are expired though. 
- So I'm not sure if I can advise you something worthy because those exams are completely changed compared to the the ones back in the days.
- Last but not least, I'm an active / valid CCNP holder who also has a few cloud certifications that Microsoft has to offer.
